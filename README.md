### 1.1.2. Introduction

This is a cleaner interface for the access of the CIA world factbook.

It is currently (12/24/21) using the version 2020 found at [https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/).

__N.B. THIS DOES NOT MODIFY THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF THE WORLDFACTBOOK.__

The intention of this project is to simply provide a simple way to open and access the documents provided by the CIA.

This also provides all of the original documents, in the ["old"](old/) folder.

This is a work in progress, so please be patient and feel free to create a pull request if you feel something is lacking.
