# Knowledge Tree

A basic tree of knowledge, that this site will strive to allow access to.

## What is a Knowledge Tree?

A knowledge tree is a system of fundimentals that an individual should be able to master.

## Terminology

This Knowledge Tree has not just one trunk, but three.

A *trunk* is a basic field of knowledge. The trunks include Sciences, Mathmatics, and Histories.

It is presumed that every aspect of human knowledge is under one of these three branches.

Each trunk has at least two *branches*. A branch can be a field of study, such as topology in Mathmatics, or botony in Sciences.

Each branch should have at least one *twig*, or a specific skill in that field. An example would be differential calculus in calculus.

Finally, each twig has a *leaf*, or a task one must know how to complete in that field. This could be the date or signifance of a specific historical event, or knowledge of the uses of the quadradic formula.
