                political commentator and accountant, &quot;call[ed] on the
                Internet for demonstrations to be held in support of greater
                freedoms in Libya&quot; inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian
                revolutions. He was arrested on 1 February by plain-clothes
                police officers, and charged on 3 February with injuring someone
                with his car. Amnesty International stated that because al-Hajji
                had previously been imprisoned for his non-violent political
                opinions, the real reason for the present arrest appeared to be
                his call for demonstrations.[47] In early February, Gaddafi, on
                behalf of the Jamahiriya, met with political activists,
                journalists and media figures and warned them that they would be
                held responsible if they disturbed the peace or created chaos in
                Libya.[48] The plans to protest were inspired by the Tunisian
                and Egyptian revolution.[48]</td>

                protesters were allowed to reoccupy the roundabout where they
                staged large marches amounting to 150,000 participants. On 14

                entered the country, which the opposition called an

                face harassment from students and faculty alike. Shia are

                septuagenarians were provoked by police firing at them with live
                ammunition. On 4 October, he called for calm, stating, &quot;The
