            <div class='faqQuestion'>Can you provide additional information for a specific country?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>The staff cannot provide data beyond what appears in <em>The World
                    Factbook</em>. The format and information in the <em>Factbook</em> are tailored to the specific requirements of US Government officials and content is focused on their current and anticipated needs. The staff welcomes suggestions for
                new entries.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'><em></em>How often is <em>The World Factbook</em> updated?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>Formerly the website and the published <em>Factbook</em> were only updated annually. In November 2001, the <em>Factbook</em> began more frequent online updating and for many years bi-weekly updates were the norm. In late 2010, online updating
                on weekly basis began and that schedule continues today. <br /><br />The CIA discontinued publishing the printed <em>Factbook</em> after the 2007 edition; subsequent annual editions were published by the US Government Printing Office through
                the 2016-17 edition. Although no longer produced in hardcopy, annual online editions of <em>The World Factbook</em> are accessible on the <em>Factbook</em> website and may be downloaded in whole or in part.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'>Can I use some or all of <em>The World Factbook</em> for my website (book, research project, homework, etc.)?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'><em>The World Factbook</em> is in the public domain and may be used freely by anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code (Section 403m) prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which implies that the CIA approved, endorsed,
                or authorized such use. For any questions about your intended use, you should consult with legal counsel. Further information on use of <em>The World Factbook</em> is described on the <a class="Normal" href="contributor_copyright.html">Contributors and Copyright
                    Information</a> page. As a courtesy, please cite <em>The World Factbook</em> when used.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why are there discrepancies between <em>The World Factbook's</em> demographic statistics and other sources?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>Although estimates and projections start with the same basic data from censuses, surveys, and registration systems, final estimates and projections can differ as a result of factors including <em>data availability, assessment, and methods and protocols</em>.
                <p><em>Data availability</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers may obtain specific country data at different times. Estimates or projections developed before the results of a census have been released will not be as accurate as those that take into
                    account new census results.</p>
                <p><em>Assessment</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers can differ in their assessment of data quality and in their estimates based on the available country data. They often need to adjust their estimates due to such factors as undercounting in a census
                    or underregistration of births or deaths.</p>
                <p><em>Methods and protocols</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences in methods and protocols can shape the way estimates and projections are made of fertility, mortality, and international migration, and how these data are integrated with the population
                    data. For example, the US Census Bureau uses a model that projects the population ahead by single years of age, a single year at a time (population statistics used in the
                    <em>Factbook </em> are based on this model), whereas the United Nations model projects five-year age groups forward, five years at a time.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'>When I do the arithmetic using your information I get a different answer for some fields. For example, the per capita GDP that I calculated using <em>World Factbook</em> GDP and population numbers differs substantially for some countries from
                the GDP - per capita numbers provided in the Economy section of the <em>Factbook</em>.</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'><em>World Factbook</em> data may be based on different dates of information. In the above example, the GDP - per capita numbers are for <strong>past</strong> years where each year's GDP is the population number divided by the relevant year.
                The population numbers shown in the People category are estimates for the <strong>current year</strong> and should not be used to calculate per capita income for earlier years.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why doesn't <em>The World Factbook</em> include information on states, departments, provinces, etc., for each country?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'><em>The World Factbook</em> provides national-level information on countries, territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative units within a country. A comprehensive encyclopedia might be a source for state/province-level
                information.
            </div>

        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'>Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration between the producers of
                <em>The World Factbook</em> and other organizations or individuals?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'><em>The World Factbook</em> does not partner with other organizations or individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such groups or persons choose to provide.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'>Is it possible to access older editions of <em>The World Factbook</em> to do comparative research and trend analysis?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>Previous editions of the <em>Factbook</em>, beginning with 2000, are available for downloading - but not browsing - on the CIA website. Rehosted versions of earlier editions of the
                <em>Factbook </em> are available for browsing, as well as for downloading, at other Internet web sites. We urge caution, however, in attempting to create time series by stringing together economic data - especially dollar values - from
                previous editions of the <em>Factbook </em>. Over time, data sources, definitions, and economic accounting methods have changed. We occasionally have made these changes ourselves in order to provide our readers with the best information
                available. Also, in the case of dollar values, changes in relative exchange rates and prices may make trends difficult to comprehend. Therefore, individuals should consult additional resources when doing comparative research or trend analysis.</div>

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why can't I find a geographic name for a particular country?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'><em>The World Factbook</em> is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of places, usually with descriptive or statistical information) and cannot provide more than the names of the administrative divisions (in the Government category) and major
                cities/towns (on the country maps). Our expanded
                <em><a href="../appendix/appendix-f.html">Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names (Appendix F)</a></em>, however, includes many of the world&rsquo;s major geographic features as well as historic (former) names of countries and cities

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why is the European Union listed out of alphabetical order at the end of the

            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>The <a class="Normal" href="../geos/ee.html">European Union</a> (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many nation-like attributes and these may be expanded in the future. It is for these reasons that a separate European Union entry was
                created. However, because of the EU's special status, this entry appears after the country listing. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into the
                <em>Factbook</em> may be found in the "Preliminary statement" of the European Union entry.<br /><br />

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican, why is this entity not listed in the <em>Factbook</em>?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>Vatican City is found under <a class="Normal" href="../geos/vt.html">Holy
                    See</a>. The term "Holy See" refers to the authority and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. As the jurisdictional equal of a state, the Holy See can enter into treaties and sends
                and receives diplomatic representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under international law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or receive diplomatic representatives.
                Consequently, Holy See is included as a <em>Factbook</em> entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in the Geographic Names appendix.</div>

            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>
                <p><em>The World Factbook</em> provides information on the administrative divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government that develops policies, principles,
                    and procedures governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic names - domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to uniform names of
                    geographic features.</p>
                <p>Also included in the <em>Factbook</em> are entries on parts of the world whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute among countries are not covered.</p>

            <div class='faqQuestion'>What do you mean when you say that a country is "doubly landlocked"?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. <a class="Normal" href="../geos/uz.html">Uzbekistan</a> and
                <a class="Normal" href="../geos/ls.html">Liechtenstein</a> are the only countries that fit this definition.

                <p>Why is the area of the United States described as "slightly larger than China" in the <em>Factbook </em>, while other sources list China as larger in area than the United States?</p>
            </div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>
                <p>It all depends on whether one is looking at total area (land and water) when making the comparison (which is the criterion used by the <em>Factbook</em>) or just land area (which excludes inland water features such as rivers and lakes).</p>
                <p>Total area (combining land and water)</p>
                <p>United States = 9,826,630 sq km China = 9,596,960 sq km</p>

                <p>United States = 9,161,923 sq km China = 9,326,410 sq km</p>

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why has <em>The World Factbook </em> dropped the five French departments of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, Reunion, and French Guiana?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>The five entities are no longer in <em>The World Factbook </em> because their status has changed. While they are overseas departments of France, they are also now recognized as French regions, having equal status to the 22 metropolitan regions
                that make up European France. In other words, they are now recognized as being part of France proper. Their status is somewhat analogous to Alaska and Hawaii vis-&agrave;-vis the contiguous United States. Although separated from the larger
                geographic entity, they are still considered to be an integral part of it.</div>

            <div class='faqQuestion'>The names of some geographic features provided in the <em>Factbook</em> differ from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia the <em>Factbook</em> has Burma as the country name, but in other publications Myanmar is used; also,
                the <em>Factbook</em> uses Sea of Japan whereas other publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on naming geographic features?
            </div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>The <em>Factbook</em> staff follows the guidance of the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the spelling, use,
                and application of geographic names - domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to uniform names of geographic features. The position of the BGN is

        <div>
            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why is most of the statistical information in the <em>Factbook</em> given in metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991 to use the International System of Units, commonly referred to as the metric system or SI. In addition, the

            <div class='faqQuestion'>What rounding convention does <em>The World Factbook</em> use?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>In deciding on the number of digits to present, the <em>Factbook</em> staff assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by computer - either at the source or by
                the <em>Factbook</em> staff. The economic data presented in The <em>Factbook</em>, therefore, follow the rounding convention used by virtually all numerical software applications, namely, any digit followed by a "5" is rounded up to the
                next higher digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus, for example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3, rather than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.</div>

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why do you list "Independence" dates for countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom?
            </div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>For most countries, this entry presents the date that sovereignty was achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For other countries, the date may be some other significant nationhood event such as the traditional founding date
                or the date of unification, federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession and so may not strictly be an "Independence" date. Dependent entities have the nature of their dependency status noted in this same entry.</div>

                <em>The World Factbook</em> different than their spelling in my country?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>The <em>Factbook</em> staff applies the names and spellings from the
                <em>Chiefs of State</em> link on the CIA Web site. <em>The World Factbook</em> is prepared using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in its spellings.

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why does the spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative divisions, etc. in the <em>Factbook</em> differ from those used in my country?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the spelling, use, and application
                of geographic names - domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to use uniform names of geographic features. (A <em>note</em> is usually included where changes may
                have occurred but have not yet been approved by the BGN). <em>The World Factbook</em> is prepared using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in its

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why does <em>The World Factbook</em> omit pronunciations of country or leader names?
            </div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>There are too many variations in pronunciation among English-speaking countries, not to mention English renditions of non-English names, for pronunciations to be included. American English pronunciations <em>are</em> included for some countries
                such as <a class="Normal" href="../geos/qa.html">Qatar</a> and <a class="Normal" href="../geos/kr.html">Kiribati</a>.</div>

            <div class='faqQuestion'>Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?</div>
            <div class='faqAnswer category_data'>When American and British spellings of common English words differ, <em>The
                        World Factbook</em> always uses the American spelling, even when these common words form part of a proper name in British English.</div>
